# HFCMA:Hierarchical Fine-grained Cross-modal Alignment via Dynamic Granularity Discovery and Optimal Transport

Implementation of **Hierarchical Fine-grained Cross-modal Alignment via Dynamic Granularity Discovery and Optimal Transport**.

HFCMA is a fine-grained image-text retrieval framework built on a CLIP-style dual encoder. It progressively organizes low-level patch/token representations into adaptive visual regions and textual phrases, then performs structured region-phrase matching with entropy-regularized optimal transport.

## Abstract

Fine-grained image-text retrieval requires a model not only to assess global semantic consistency between an image and a text, but also to model visual evidence for local textual semantics, including objects, attributes, quantities, actions, and relations, so as to distinguish semantically similar candidates. Existing methods commonly use fixed image patches, detected regions, or text tokens as the basic matching units and then aggregate local interactions through max pooling, cross attention, or similarity accumulation. Such strategies remain limited in semantic unit construction and global matching consistency. This paper proposes a hierarchical fine-grained cross-modal alignment framework, termed HFCMA. The framework progressively transforms low-level patch and token representations into adaptive visual regions and textual phrases, and then performs structured region-phrase matching within a global retrieval scoring process. Specifically, HFCMA first adopts dynamic granularity discovery (DGD) to aggregate raw patches and tokens into semantically compact visual regions and textual phrases. It then formulates region-phrase matching as an entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT) problem, thereby estimating a structured alignment matrix under global marginal constraints. To reduce background noise and local semantic drift, HFCMA further introduces background debiasing, textual importance weighting, and prototype consistency regularization. Experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO show that HFCMA effectively combines dynamic semantic unit construction with OT-based structured matching under a dual-encoder retrieval framework. The resulting fine-grained score provides structured local alignment information for candidate ranking and improves the discrimination of subtle semantic differences.

## Installation

```bash
conda create -n hfcma python=3.10 -y
conda activate hfcma
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

The default configuration uses OpenAI CLIP ViT-L/14 through OpenCLIP. A CUDA GPU is recommended for training and reranking.

## Data Format

Prepare each dataset as a JSON list. Each entry corresponds to one image and its captions:

```json
{
  "image": "train2014/COCO_train2014_000000000009.jpg",
  "captions": [
    "A group of people standing near a bus.",
    "People are waiting beside a bus."
  ],
  "image_id": 9,
  "split": "train"
}
```

Recommended local layout:

```text
data/
|-- flickr30k/
|   |-- images/
|   `-- cache/flickr30k_all.json
`-- coco/
    |-- images/
    `-- cache/coco_all.json
```

See `docs/DATA.md` for supported fields and evaluation protocol notes.

If your annotations follow the Karpathy-style JSON format, convert them with:

```bash
python tools/convert_retrieval_json.py \
  --input path/to/dataset_karpathy.json \
  --output data/flickr30k/cache/flickr30k_all.json
```

## Training

Flickr30K:

```bash
bash scripts/train_flickr30k.sh
```

MS-COCO:

```bash
bash scripts/train_coco.sh
```

The scripts train the HFCMA head with the CLIP backbone frozen.

## Evaluation

Flickr30K:

```bash
bash scripts/eval_flickr30k.sh
```

MS-COCO:

```bash
bash scripts/eval_coco.sh
```

Evaluation computes global CLIP similarities and reranks top-ranked candidates with the HFCMA fine-grained OT score.

## Sanity Checks

Run the lightweight tests before launching a full experiment:

```bash
pytest tests
```

These tests verify retrieval-metric computation and the marginal constraints of the Sinkhorn transport plan.

## Expected Results

The manuscript reports the following main RSUM values. Minor variation is expected across hardware, CUDA version, annotation conversion, and random seed.
